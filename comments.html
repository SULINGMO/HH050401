    <p>
      Simple wireframes on the right show the structure of the four HTML pages
      and what they look like. There are 3 cards with “Read More” buttons on the
      homepage. With these buttons, the users can move to other pages, or stick
      to the top navigation bar. On the other three pages, there are links to
      those using the top navigation bar.

  <div class="color_interdesign">
    <img class="flatde" alt="flat design example" src="./image/flatdesign_eg.jpg" />
    <p>
      As for colour scheme, I chose dark blue, dark green and orange with white.
      Dark tones to show your professionalism and your logical side, that is
      what an IT Degree student should be! But the orange one gives a bit of
      enthusiasm to also let you know, that I&#39;m passionate also for IT. I
      adopted flat design for the design style that, I hope, can give readers a
      facile and nifty way to read and show the reader part of my personality,
      some experiences and something I want in the future.

  <div class="alt_css">
    <img class="alt_cssuse" alt="index page without css" src="./image/withoutcss.jpg" />
    <p>
      alt tag is useful by presenting alternative text when website is not able
      to render a image. And regarding the css, removing it or disabling it
      would make the layout on the website a mess. But, the user could get about
      the pages by using the navigation bar. That being said, the site&#39;s
      aesthetics and user experience would take a huge hit. This proves the
      importance of CSS for every web.
