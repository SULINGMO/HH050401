      <p>
        In high school I was well interested in coding. It wasn&#39;t on the
        schools a curriculum, but I would check it out on my own. I began
        watching online tutorials and taught myself in my spare time. I
        picked up some basics, such as basic HTML and CSS, which gave me insight
        into how websites are built. This hit home for me and allowed me to be
        more confident in wanting to follow coding earnestly in the future and
        also learn beyond the class.

      <p>
        On the school break, I took my own initiative and self-source me an
        internship at a business company. They accepted me as an intern for a 3
        month program, where I helped the team with their internal systems and
        day to day processes. With a small bit of code-crunching, I was able to
        get them up on their feet and did little things to make their internal
        tools better. This practical experience improved my understanding of how
        coding is done in real business environment and increased my interest in
        technology and problem solving.
