      <p>
        In the future I&#39;d like to work in an IT-based position utilising the
        skills I&#39;ve learned as part of my UTS Artificial Intelligence degree.
        This might span going into a job in machine learning, data science, AI
        implementation, or software engineering-disciplines where I can
        contribute to developing intelligent systems to address real-world
        problems with technology(ies). I&#39;m also really keen on pursuing further
        education in computing with a Master&#39;s or even a PhD to take my
        knowledge to the next level and open up even more advanced opportunities
        within the tech world.
